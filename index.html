The threat of inundation will be compounded by climate change; as is outlined in the Draft National Climate Change Policy, building setbacks should be increased to mitigate this.

As a result, the site offers little natural protection from wave action during inclement weather (both during storms and hurricanes) with damage to some structures along this coastline experienced on a relatively regular basis. These effects will be only exacerbated in future years by a changing climate resulting in increased incidents of higher intensity storms. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that any development on the site is responsive to the environmental hazards presented by its location. Generally, the natural vegetation line is a good indicator of the energy of the coastline and the incursion of the sea on a regular basis.</q><br/><q>We note that the retaining wall and pool do not meet the minimum statutory required coastal setback of 50ft for ironshore coastlines (defined in the Planning Regulations). Given the climate change predictions for the region, including sea level rise and increased intensity of storm events (including storm surge), coastal setbacks should not be reduced but instead should be treated as a minimum (as prescribed in the Regulations). It is important to highlight that setbacks seek to provide protection to properties against these inevitable effects of climate change. As examples, the Department notes the damage received to the pilings installed during the attempted construction of the proposed dock directly off-shore of the subject parcel caused by Hurricane Nate in early October 2017. In addition, we also note the damage received to Macabuca's patio area late last year (see Figures 3 & 4). For these reasons, the Department does not support a variance on coastal setbacks. As Section 7 of the National Conservation Law had not yet been enacted in January 2016 when the initial application was received, the Department was unable to provide these comments sooner as we were not consulted on the initial application. Unfortunately, as construction has already begun on the  retaining wall and pool in the positions shown on the applicant's site plan, we are no longer able to recommend that these structures are  repositioned to meet the required 50ft minimum setback.</q></td><td>The application was approved without any record of the CPA's consideration of the DoE's comments. <br /><br /></td></tr></table><br />"

Given this is an ironshore coastline, the presence of sand indicates that this is also a high-energy coastline as the sand present would have been thrown up onto the site during storm events. This is evidenced in the historical imagery. As a result, the site offers little natural protection from wave action during inclement weather (both during storms and hurricanes) with damage to some structures along this coastline experienced on a relatively regular basis. These effects will be only exacerbated in future years by a changing climate resulting in an increased incidence of higher-intensity storms.</q><br /><br /><q>The application site's coastline highlights the need for site-specific consideration of setbacks instead of an overall 'blanket' setback approach for the generalised categories of beaches, ironshore or mangrove coastlines. The applicant has positioned the proposed pool 50 feet from the Mean High Water Mark which is the minimum coastal setback prescribed in the Development and Planning Regulations (2022). However, the currently proposed pool is likely still sited in a vulnerable location. Coastal setback recommendations should also be informed by other factors such as the off-shore marine environment, historical erosion rates or extreme water levels, rather than adopting arbitrary distances that are not representative of erosion and coastal flooding threats. Generally, the natural/permanent vegetation line is a good indicator of the energy of the coastline and the incursion of the sea on a regular basis. For example, the presence of permanent mature vegetation shows that the area of the coastline is relatively stable. Although the site has been heavily modified in the past, a review of aerial imagery along this coastline shows that the mature vegetation line would have exceeded 50 feet. Any development that is situated seaward of the approximate historical vegetation line increases its vulnerability to flooding and storm damage. </q><br /><q>We recommend the applicant considers exceeding the minimum coastal setback of 50 feet by repositioning the development and all ancillary structures (including the pool) further away from the sea and/or incorporating climate-resilient features such as raised/wash-through foundations to increase the development's climate resiliency.</q></td><td><q>The proposal complies with the minimum required setback from the high water mark. In fact, the proposed apartment building is setback an additional 25' from the minimum required 50'. Also, the building will be setback about 35' further from the high water mark than the existing building. The Authority is of the view that no reasonable rationale has been provided to require the building to be setback 100'. Simply because a few neighbouring property owners chose to set back their houses 100' is not sufficient reason to require this applicant to do the same.</q><br /><br /><q>Another Point</q></td></tr></table><br /><img src='"+picURL11+"' width=400 />"

Storm impacts to the coastline are indicated by the presence of sand deposits and the setback of the natural vegetation line on the ironshore.

The apartments which previously occupied the site were destroyed by Hurricane Ivan. We recognise that the apartments have been designed to reduce the likelihood of storm damage (e.g. increased setback, car parking on ground floor) and we do not object to the condominiums or proposed modifications to the existing seapool. Our concern is with the new beach area. With even small wave action at the site, the sand at the new beach area will be carried into the Marine Park and cause sediment to enter and pollute the Marine Protected Area. Sedimentation causes direct and indirect effects on coral reefs through turbidity, loss of light and direct smothering. Sedimentation kills corals by shading and smothering them and reduces the recruitment of juvenile corals. Corals that are stressed by sedimentation have a greater likelihood of being subject to disease. In addition to the intrinsic value of the environment, a key selling point for the new Dolphin Point Apartments is likely to be the excellent snorkelling and diving directly off-shore from the condominiums. The presence of the new beach area puts that at risk as it will decrease the quality of the snorkelling.</q> The Director of the DoE directed on behalf of the NCC that the structures within the coastal setback be removed.<br /><br /></td><td><p>The CPA included the directed conditions and the applicant removed the beach area. </p><br /><br /><q>Another Point</q></td></tr></table><br /><img src='"+picURL9+"' width=400 />"
