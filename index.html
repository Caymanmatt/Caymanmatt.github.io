      data-text="As the Blue Belt Programme Officer and Cayman team lead for the Research Expedition, I’ll be onboard the R.R.S James Cook for the full 6-week expedition.\n\nIn addition to being involved in all areas of research, an important part of my role is to collaborate and foster connections between the Cayman Islands, our UKOT neighbours (Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands) and the UK Government.\n\nI’m really excited to learn more about what makes the offshore banks a preferred habitat for important fish species and to discover more about the species of deep sea snapper we have and their life history.">

    <area target="" href="" coords="1049,214,1331,517" shape="rect" data-text="I am a Marine Research Officer with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, specializing in reef research and fish population dynamics. I will join the RV James Cook for the Cayman leg of the expedition and am particularly excited to expand our understanding of local pelagic ecosystems through midwater trawling, BRUV deployments, and fishing trawls. While our department has extensive data on nearshore reef fisheries, our knowledge of species composition and abundance in pelagic habitats remains limited. We have conducted some midwater BRUV work off the shelf and at 12-Mile Bank, and I look forward to the opportunity to replicate and extend these deployments at the more distant banks.">
    <area target="" href="" coords="1526,215,1790,515" shape="rect" data-text="Growing up surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, I was captivated by the marine environment from an early age.  I learned to dive at age 10 years old and completed my Masters in Marine Resource Development and Protection, before starting at the Department of Environment in 2020. I work closely with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which provides vital mapping and data support to field research teams.\n\nIn 2022, I was offered the opportunity to join the scientific verification expedition team on Research Vessel Atlantis for a month, and became the first Caymanian to explore the Cayman Trench descending to 4,993 metres (16,381 feet) via deep-sea submersible HOV Alvin. I am thrilled to be joining my colleagues as part of the Cayman crew aboard RRS James Cook in February 2026 to continue to explore the mysteries of the deep-sea.">

    <area target="" href="" coords="566,666,847,968" shape="rect" data-text="I’ve been a member of the DoE’s Coral Management Team since 2023, specializing in coral reef health and restoration, with special focus on caring for DoE’s coral nurseries. I also lead DoE’s photogrammetry project, in which coral reef health is being analysed using 3D imagery.\n\nDuring the James Cook research expedition, Megan will be a part of the camera work team, using deep sea cameras to look at the benthic environment of the seafloor and seamounts surrounding the islands. She hopes to identify and categorize the deep-sea corals that have made Cayman their home.">
    <area target="" href="" coords="1056,668,1331,965" shape="rect" data-text="A conservation biologist with 15 years’ experience, I have worked extensively on Cayman’s seabird populations. Work has included the oversight of the species Conservation Plan, annual population monitoring, habitat mapping, public education and outreach as well as the tracking of Brown Booby, Red-footed Booby and Magnificent Frigatebirds.\n\nI very much hope to gain insight into how the local breeding populations of seabirds utilize the off-shore banks and marine habitats to bridge this significant knowledge gap, linking marine and terrestrial ecosystems in and around the Cayman Islands.">

I’ll be studying seabirds during the voyage and I’m especially excited to learn more about which species are using Cayman waters. There have been very few studies or pelagic observations in this area, so I’m really looking forward to help fill those gaps and discovering more about these incredible birds and their connection to our islands.">
